# Sustaining our Soil for our Food

Capstone project for graduate MPS in Data Analytics &amp; Visualization degree, Maryland Institute College of Art.
December 2021

## Summary for Food Consumers
**With 7.9 Billion humans on Earth as of November 2021, and an expected 10 Billion in the year 2057 (United Nations/Worldomter), as consumers we individually and collectively hold great potential to maintain and restore the grand resource of our soil,** through purchasing power to support food producers and advocacy to policy makers. This project investigates the intersection of organic carbon storage in soil with climate change and food production sustainability. Its success measure is introducing people who buy and eat food to an appreciation of the importance of soil organic carbon content where foods they eat are produced, even if that land is far away.

The appeal of the interactive visual web tool is to compel consumers to further engage in their food chain and ecosystem roles, such as to learn about regenerative agriculture practices that build and maintain soil health and its storage of carbon matter as a valuable offset to carbon emissions, for which suggested action steps will be provided. 

While debate and analysis continues worldwide about how effective soil carbon is in offsetting greenhouse gas emissions, likelihood grows that U.S. government certified voluntary environmental credit markets will be a reality with the progress of the Growing Climate Solutions Act of 2021. Meeting this bill’s directive will require the alignment of consumers at scale to reduce barriers to entry for food producers in adopting regenerative practices to earn monetary credits. By approaching soil carbon through food, this project adds a more everyday relatable human element in the increasing body of scientific material and visualization growing around soil health and its implications.

### Acknowledgments
Though being developed during a highly isolated and independent time socially, and entirely remote educational experience, learning to build this app wouldn't be possible without a circle of folks and resources I lean into for which I'm grateful. You've all inspired new directions and given legs to my work. 

- my Capstone course Instructor <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tracy-sanders-04881827/">Tracy Sanders</a> especially for pressing me on important questions, 
- Tracy's Course Collaborator <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jes-standefer/">Jes Standefer</a>, 
- my Instructor for MICA Python workshops <a href="https://lwgray.github.io/">Lawrence Gray, PhD</a>, who's become a mentor of mine and has supported me in collaboratively debugging code from Python to CSS and beyond as well as often with much needed good old fashioned logic checks and balances when I get off track with relating the code to the outcome, and an insightful listening ear and accountability boost. 
- the classmates in my cohorts for generous feedback, ideas, and the opportunity to participate in your visualization projects too through which I've learned much more,
- Adam at Charming Data for excellent instructional content being developed and shared regularly for the Python Plotly and Dash community. Check out the videos and and support Adam's course development and passion for growing a more inclusive and financially accessible developer community at <a href="https://www.patreon.com/charmingdata">patreon.com/charmingdata</a>
- Elias Dabbas and Packt> Publishing for putting out a great <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/product/interactive-dashboards-and-data-apps-with-plotly-and-dash/9781800568914">book on building Dash apps</a>.  Hey you can read it along with me or find it from other stores through <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57365048-interactive-dashboards-and-data-apps-with-plotly-and-dash">goodreads</a>.
- esteemed food producers and soil scientists doing the critical work and data collection for–and in–our soil–worldwide, and specifically Land-Atmosphere Interaction Research Group at Sun Yat-sen University for the thought, testing, and documentation you put into data harmonization across global datasets available to continue this work without delay at the speed of climate change. Soil and learning are resources we can never forget to nourish, and I hope this work honors and connects us all more with you and our land.
- my family who is held up highest for your openminded and intentional, though occasionally faltering or reluctant, love and humor throughout my graduate degree program,
- and perhaps your name here to thank as this work progresses...
