# Valuing Soil Health to Lower Risk and Slow Climate Change

Capstone project for MPS in Data Analytics &amp; Visualization, Maryland Institute College of Art.
December 2021

## Summary
This project investigates the intersection of regenerative agriculture and food production practices that build and maintain soil health and especially its storage of organic carbon matter, with the value of the land on which food is produced and the slowing of human induced climate change. The visual tools and artifacts of this research endeavor to grow and capitalize on alignment among food ecosystem stakeholders for mutual benefits–namely the farmers and producers of our food, each of us as consumers who eat, and funders and both public and private lenders of capital as well as owners of land leased for food production. 

Addressing food producers’ specific needs in working with financiers and landowners is emphasized which will also lead to greater common investment. A link to a full research paper will be forthcoming.
