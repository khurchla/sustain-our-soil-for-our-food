# Sustaining our Soil for our Food

Capstone project for MPS in Data Analytics &amp; Visualization, Maryland Institute College of Art.
December 2021

## Summary for Food Consumers
**WIth 7.9 Billion humans on Earth as of November 2021, and an expected 10 Billion in the year 2057 (United Nations/Worldomter), as consumers we individually and collectively hold great potential to maintain and restore the grand resource of our soil,** through purchasing power to support food producers and advocacy to policy makers. This project investigates the intersection of organic carbon storage in soil with climate change and food production sustainability. Its success measure is introducing people who buy and eat food to an appreciation of the importance of soil organic carbon content where foods they eat are produced, even if that land is far away.

The appeal of the interactive visual web tool is to compel consumers to further engage in their food chain and ecosystem roles, such as to learn about regenerative agriculture practices that build and maintain soil health and its storage of carbon matter as a valuable offset to carbon emissions, for which suggested action steps will be provided. 

While debate and analysis continues worldwide about how effective soil carbon is in offsetting greenhouse gas emissions, likelihood grows that U.S. government certified voluntary environmental credit markets will be a reality with the progress of the Growing Climate Solutions Act of 2021. Meeting this bill’s directive will require the alignment of consumers at scale to reduce barriers to entry for food producers in adopting regenerative practices to earn monetary credits. By approaching soil carbon through food, this project adds a more everyday relatable human element in the increasing body of scientific material and visualization growing around soil health and its implications.

### Acknowledgments
Thank you to my Instructor <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tracy-sanders-04881827/">Tracy Sanders</a> especially for pressing me on important questions, Course Collaborator <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jes-standefer/">Jes Standefer</a>, a mentor of mine <a href="https://lwgray.github.io/">Lawrence Gray, PhD</a> who has supported me in both computer programming instruction and collaboratively debugging code as well as often with much needed checks and balances when my logic gets off track and an accountable and insightful listening ear. I'm grateful to the classmates in my cohorts for generous feedback, ideas, and the opportunity to participate in your visualizations as well. You have all inspired new directions and given legs to my work. I hope this work honors and connects us all more with the esteemed food producers and soil scientists doing the critical work for–and in–our soil. My family is held up highest for their unwavering, though sometimes faltering or reluctant, love and humor throughout my graduate degree–soil and learning are resources we can never forget to nourish. I'm sure I'll have more of you to thank as this work progresses.
